# Booker T. Washington Presentations

The RoboHornets have a table at Booker T.’s Freshman Orientation, Back-to-School-Night, and Showcase Night in order to introduce more Hornets to FIRST. These are our biggest recruiting opportunities each year year.

In addition to appearing at showcases, we give presentations to freshman at the beginning of the year to encourage rookies to join our team . We also appear at school events, like tail gates, to show what our team does. The presentations bring awareness to FIRST events and the importance of STEM within our school.
