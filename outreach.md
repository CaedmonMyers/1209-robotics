    The Chairman’s Award recognizes a team that exemplifies FIRST values: a team that other teams can look up to. This team embodies all the ideals of FIRST including gracious professionalism. The award application includes an essay in addition to short answer responses and a video, all of which explain how our team exemplifies the ideals of FIRST.

     These are our biggest recruiting opportunities each year year. In addition to appearing at showcases, we give presentations to freshman at the beginning of the year to encourage rookies to join our team . We also appear at school events, like tail gates, to show what our team does. The presentations bring awareness to FIRST events and the importance of STEM within our school.
